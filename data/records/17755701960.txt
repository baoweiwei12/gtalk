消息: To determine the composition and absolute quantification of fatty acids, according to the procedure described in our previous study, Gonads (100 mg) from 12 sea urchines were separately analyzed using a TRACE™1310 ISQ gas chromatograph (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) (Wang et al., 2019). The fats and fatty acids in the samples were extracted by hydrolysis, the fats were extracted into ether, and then methylated to obtain fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). Quantitative determination was performed using a gas chromatograph. Hydrolysis: Samples were mixed with pyrogallic acid and 2 mL of 95% ethanol and 10 mL of hydrochloric acid were added. The mixture was hydrolyzed at 70-80◦C for 40 min, then the flask was removed from the water bath and cooled to room temperature. Extraction: After sample hydrolysis, 10 mL of 95% ethanol and 50 mL of diethyl ether were added and shaken for 5 min. The ether layer was removed into the tube, and the ether was evaporated by a water bath. For methylation, 2 mL of 2% NaoH-methanol and 3 mL of 14% BF3-methanol were extracted and heated at 85◦ for 30 min before cooling to room temperature. The hexyl hydride mixture was centrifuged and the fatty acid methyl ester was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter before gas column chromatography. In this study, 33 kinds of free fatty acids were detected and analyzed in sea urchin. The content of each fatty acid was calculated according to the formula :W = C*V*N m *k W: fatty acid content in the sample (mg/kg); C: Fatty acid methyl ester concentration (mg/L); V: equal volume (mL); k: coefficient of conversion of each fatty acid methyl ester to fatty acid; N: dilution ratio; m: Sample weight (g).翻译

After cooling, it was quantified in a 50ml volumetric flask with deionized water. The standard solution and sample were injected with 20.0μl each and quantified by the standard area. Conditions of liquid chromatography: Column: Hypersil ODS amino acid analysis column, length 20cm, inner diameter 2.1nm; Column temperature: 40.0℃; Flow rate: 0.45ml/min.

消息: The main process was as follows: eukaryotic mRNA was enriched by magnetic beads with Oligo (dT); Fragmentation Buffer(Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) was added to interrupt mRNA randomly. Using mRNA as template, the first cDNA strand was synthesized with random hexamers, and then buffer, dNTPs, RNase H and DNA polymerase I were added to synthesize the second cDNA strand. AMPure XP beads(Beijing Norbolide Technology Co LTD, China) were used to purify cDNA. The purified double-stranded cDNA was subjected to end repair, A-tail addition, sequencing adaptor, and AMPure XP beads for fragment size selection. Finally, cDNA libraries were obtained by PCR enrichment. After the library was constructed, the effective concentration of the library (library effective concentration > 2nM) was accurately quantified by Q-PCR method to ensure the quality of the library. After library inspection, different libraries were pooled according to the target amount of data, and sequenced by Illumina(NovaSeq,USA) platform. Differential expression genes were screened by differential analysis software based on the Count value of genes in each sample. DESeq2[21] software was used to analyze the differences between groups with biological duplication. Fold Change≥1.5 and Pvalue<0.01 were used as screening criteria in the detection of differentially expressed genes. The Clean Data were filtered and compared with the transcriptome Data of Sea urchin medius. The Mapped Data were used to evaluate the quality of the library, such as insert length test and randomness test. Alternative splicing analysis, novel gene discovery and gene structure optimization were performed. According to the expression level of genes in different samples or different groups of samples, differential expression analysis, functional annotation and functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes were performed翻译

消息: 2.7 Gene enrichment analysis: 
The transcriptome data were referred to the genome of sea urchin intermedius measured in our laboratory, and the function of differentially expressed genes was annotated in the database. The Cluster of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COG) database is constructed based on the phylogenetic relationships of bacteria, algae and eukaryotes. The gene products can be classified by direct homology using COG database. The GO database aims to establish a standard vocabulary for knowledge of genes and their products, which is applicable to each species. The GO annotation system is a directed acyclic graph with three main branches, namely: Biological Process, Molecular Function and Cellular Component; KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) is a database for systematic analysis of gene function and genome information, which helps researchers to study gene and expression information as a whole network. As the main public database on pathways (Kanehisa,2008), the integrated pathway query provided by KEGG, including the metabolism of carbohydrates, nucleosides, amino acids, etc., and the biodegradation of organic matter, provides all possible metabolic pathways. The enzymes catalyzing each step of the reaction were also comprehensively annotated, and P < 0.05 was considered to be significantly enriched.翻译

消息: 2.8 Real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR was used to verify the results
In order to verify the accuracy of genes related to hunger, some genes were screened for validation. For RT-qPCR validation, total RNA was extracted with Trizol (CA, USA) and then cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription using a reverse transcription kit (TAKARA, Japan). RT-Qpcr was performed using the SYBR Green dye method Mix (Shanghai Lianmai Biological Engineering Co., LTD, USA), and the primer sequences retrieved from Primer5 are shown in Table 1, with 18SrRNA as the reference gene. Reaction conditions: 60 cycles of denaturation at 95 ° C for 10s, annealing at 65 ° C for 60s, and extension at 97 ° C for 1s. Fluorescence quantitative data were calculated using the 2-ΔΔCt method.
2.9、Statistic analysis
The data were processed by Means±SD table, and spss25.0 was used for data calculation. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze the significance of monosaccharide, amino acid and fatty acid contents in the gonads of sea urchins intermedia before and after starvation (P<0.05).
